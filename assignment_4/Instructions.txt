Lab 4 - Repetition

Instructions

Create a folder called assignment_4 in your home directory. Inside this folder you should have a file named lab4.py and you should create all the required functions in it. You can use the placeholder file from the bottom of these instructions as a starting point

Exercises
1. Simple Combination Lock

Suppose we have one of those combination locks that you commonly find in high schools, or airport luggage. Suppose also that the lock has 3 dials, with numbers from 1 to 9 (inclusive). Our lock has no 0s. Your task is to write a function that takes in the combination that the lock is currently set to, and the combination that unlocks it. It should return the smallest number of operations needed to unlock the lock.

For example, suppose the unlock combination is 1 1 1, and the lock is currently at 1 1 2, then the function should return 1, because there is only 1 operation needed, namely to change the last dial from a 2 to a 1, which is 1 operation. If the lock had been set to 1 1 3, then it would have required 2 operations to unlock it, because we need to move the last dial twice. Lastly, if the lock was set to 2 2 2, then the answer is 3, because we move each one of the 3 dials once.

Your function signature should be:

def simple_lock(x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3):
where x1, x2, and x3 represent the current combination and the y-values represent the unlock combination.

Remember that dials can rotate in either direction.

2. More General Lock
Here we wish to solve the same problem as the previous exercise, namely, given two combinations, find the minumum number of operations needed to go from one to the other.

The lock we will be using here has a variable number of dials, but each dial has numbers from 1 to 9 (again, no zeros).

This time the combinations will be represented by 1 integer each. You may assume only valid combinations will be given to your function. That is both integer inputs will have the same number of digits, and they will all be between 1 and 9.

Your signatre should be:

def combo_lock(current, unlock):
For example combo_lock(111, 112) returns 1, as does combo_lock(111, 211).

3. Perfect Numbers
Perfect numbers are positive integers which are equal to the sum of their proper divisors (positive divisors excluding itself). For example, the number 6 is a perfect number because its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 3, and 6 = 1 + 2 + 3, so it is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, which makes it perfect.

Your task is to write a function that takes in an integer and returns True if the integer is perfect, and False otherwise.

The function signature should be:

def is_perfect(n):
4. The Next Perfect Number

Write a function that will take in an integer input and return the first perfect number that is strictly greater than the input value.

The signature should be:

def next_perfect(n):
5. Prime Numbers

A prime number is a positive integer that has exectly two factors, no more, no less. Write a function that takes in an integer and returns True if the integer is prime, and False otherwise.

The signature should be:

def is_prime(x):
As an example, some prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦

6. The Next Prime Number

Write a function that takes in an integer input and returns the first prime number larger than the input value.

The signature should be:

def next_prime(n):
7. Powers

Write a function that will take in two integers, a value and a base, and return True if the value is a power of the given base.

The signature should be:

def is_power(number, base):
Examples:

is_power(8, 2) returns True
is_power(9, 2) returns False

8. Coprime Numbers

Two integers are called coprime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. In the placeholder file below, there is a complete implementation of Euclid's Algorithm for finding the GCD of two integers. You may use it in this question.

Write a function that will take in two integers and return True if they are coprime, and False otherwise.

The signature should be as follows:

def coprime(x, y):
9. Euler's Totient Function

Euler's Totient function, typically denoted as phi(n) returns the number of integers that are coprime to $n$. Your task is to implement this function.

The signature should be:

def phi(n):
10. Approximating Square Roots

The divide-and-average algorithm for computing the square root of any positive number $a$ works as follows:

Start with any positive number x as an approximation of the square root

Refine the approximation by taking the average of x and a/x, and setting x to that

Repeat the above refinement step until the values of x and a/x differ by a less than some small epsilon value.

Write a function that takes in a value for a, x, and epsilon, and returns the approximation for the square root of a according to the above algorithm.

The function signature should be:

sqrt(a, x, epsilon)
Do not use the built-in Python sqrt function. The answers will differ.
