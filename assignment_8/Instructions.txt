Lab 8 - Complexity Analysis

Instructions

In your home folder create a folder called assignment_8 and create a file called lab8.txt in the assignment_8 folder.

This lab assignment has no programming questions, and therefore no automated grading. When you submit, you will receive no feedback.

In the text file you created, answer the following questions:

Write the conditions that must be satisfied in order for a complexity function f(n) to belong to O(n^2).

Show that 2n^2 + 5n + 7 is in O(n^2)

Show that 5n + 3 is in O(n)

Is it true that 5n + 3 is in O(n^2)? Prove it.

Describe the linear search algorithm. You can write pseudo code with a description of what the different parts of the algorithm are doing.

Derive a complexity function for linear search, and prove its order of complexity.

Describe the selection sort algorithm in your own words. Pseudo code is acceptable but every part of it must be described.

Derive and prove the order of complexity of selection sort.

Explain the idea behind insertion sort. How does the algorithm work?

Explain the idea behind binary search. What it its order of complexity?
